🚫 PROJECT NO LONGER MAINTAINED 🚫


After months of dedication I decided to stop this project. The only reason I started this project was so I could put it in my portfolio and also because I wanted to learn Go and needed a project to learn it.

Essentially I was working on something that I didn’t plan very well and the return on investment was too low considering the effort and energy I dedicated. 

As Nikola Tesla said in his book entitled *My Inventions*:

*“In twenty years there has not been a single exception. Why should it be otherwise? Engineering, electrical and mechanical, is positive in results. There is scarcely a subject that cannot be mathematically treated and the effects calculated or the results determined beforehand from the available theoretical and practical data. The carrying out into practise of a crude idea as is being generally done is, I hold, nothing but a waste of energy, money and time.”*
